## Part 1: App Description

Chose the an External API tool that integrates two external RESTful JSON APIs based on user input.
Depending on the input, the app displays statistics about an NBA player along with an image.

## Part 2: New

Working with API's really helped. I was struggling with JSON's before this project, but I think this
project really helped with that part. It would be relatively easy to work with API's now.

## Part 3: Retrospect

Would definitely make the app better looking from a visual aspect and would also add more features instead of 
just the NBA. Would add other leagues and sports like NFL, MLB, soccer, etc.
